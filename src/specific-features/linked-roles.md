# Linked Roles

Link your Captcha.bot account to Discord

::: info
This is **NOT** a replacement for our [advanced verification](../introduction/setup-process.md), This can be a good utility for small discord servers with small verification requirements.
:::

Captcha.bot has partnered with Discord with their new [Linked Roles](https://discord.com/blog/connected-accounts-functionality-boost-linked-roles) feature!
